# Twitter Mass Unfollow ðŸ‘‹

A simple Chrome extension to help you clean up your Twitter/X following list. Built because Twitter's native unfollow process is painfully slow, and sometimes you just need a fresh start.

## Why This Exists

- Sometimes you just want to start over
- Unfollowing accounts one by one is tedious
- Twitter's UI makes it hard to mass unfollow
- Helps when you've followed too many accounts over the years

## Quick Install

1. Clone this repo
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Turn on "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the folder containing these files

## How to Use

1. Go to twitter.com/following
2. Click the extension icon
3. Set your preferences:
   - Max accounts to unfollow
   - Delay between unfollows
4. Hit "Start Unfollowing" and let it do its thing

## Safety Features

- Built-in delays to avoid rate limiting
- Stop button to pause anytime
- Progress tracking
- Configurable limits
